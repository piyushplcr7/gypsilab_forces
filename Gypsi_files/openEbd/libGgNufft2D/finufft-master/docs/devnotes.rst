Developer notes
===============

* To update the version number, this needs to be done by hand in the following places:

  - ``docs/conf.py`` for sphinx
  - ``python/setup.py`` for the python pkg version
  - ``include/defs.h``
  - ``CHANGELOG``: don't forget to describe the new features and changes, folding lines at 80 chars.

* There are some sphinx tags in the source code, indicated by @ in comments. Please leave these alone since they are needed by the doc generation.

* Developers changing MATLAB/octave interfaces or docs, see ``matlab/README``

* Developers changing overall web docs, see ``docs/README``

* If you change any of the doc sources, which includes any of the above four items, the easiest way to regenerate everything needed is via ``make docs``. See ``makefile`` for what's going on here. Also, do not edit files ``docs/*.doc`` since these are machine-generated; your changes will be overwritten. Instead edit files ``*.docsrc`` once you have understood how the bash scripts act on them. 
  
* For testing and performance measuring routines see ``test/README`` and ``perftest/README``. We need more of the latter, eg, something making performance graphs that enable rapid eyeball comparison of various settings/machines.

* **Installing MWrap**. This is needed only to rebuild the matlab/octave interfaces.
  `MWrap <https://github.com/zgimbutas/mwrap>`_
  is a very useful MEX interface generator by Dave Bindel, now maintained
  and expanded by Zydrunas Gimbutas.
  Make sure you have ``flex`` and ``bison`` installed to build it.
  As of FINUFFT v.2.0 you will need a recent (>=0.33.10) version of MWrap.
  Make sure to override the location of MWrap by adding a line such as::

    MWRAP = your-path-to-mwrap-executable
  
  to your ``make.inc``, and then you can use the ``make mex`` task.
