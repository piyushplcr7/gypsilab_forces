README for FINUFFT documentation.

The .rst files in this directory are designed for sphinx to auto-generate
documentation in HTML (including from the readthedocs.io website), and in PDF.

Some of the source files (.doc) included in the .rst sources are
auto-generated by ourselves using custom bash scripts.  This helps with the
language interfaces. The various
dependencies of what has to come before what is encoded in

../makefile

specifically in the task "make docs". Please check its error messages when
you run that task.

Do not forget to set up your python3 environment before you run it!

Then to check the local build of the HTML docs, useful for debugging before you
wait for a git push origin to be detected by RTD, point your browser to the
local file _build/html/index.html

finufft.readthedocs.io should have been set up to be triggered by
pushes to the git repo to regenerate HTML documentation identical to the
local copy, hosted there for the world to see.

Note that ../README.md also should be considered part of the docs, since
it contains a precis for text-loving and github-facing humans.
