   The gypsilab project is a young open-source MATLAB toolbox for fast
numerical computation with finite element and boundary element methods.
Accessible with a high-level programming language, it gives a useful
framework for fast prototyping. Initially designed for numerical acoustics,
multiphysics problems can now be addressed.

   Gypsilab is divided in few libraries :  
 
 - OpenMSH : Library for mesh management  
Copyright Matthieu Aussal (c) 2017 - Ecole Polytechnique  

 - OpenDOM : Library for numerical integration and variational formulation  
Copyright Matthieu Aussal & Francois Alouges (c) 2017 - Ecole Polytechnique  

 - OpenFEM : Library for Finite Element Method.  
Copyright Matthieu Aussal & Francois Alouges (c) 2017 - Ecole Polytechnique  
 
 - OpenHmX : Library for H-Matrix computation and algebra.

Scripts for non regression test are provided to evaluate performances 
and verify computation.
